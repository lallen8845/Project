                <h3>November 11, 2017</h3>
											<span id="testingthis6"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dudhsagar Falls – the moment you hear these words, the visuals of trains passing through the falls comes to your mind. Thanks to Bollywood. This tall, tiered and perennial waterfall is a must-see destination in Goa. Bollywood films like Chennai Express has shared its spectacular visuals in front of millions even if the coordinates of the Dudhsagar falls were misplaced.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first saw the Dudhsagar waterfalls when I was on Deccan Odyssey trip. It was fun to watch the waterfall from the luxury of my personal cabin. Minutes later we were all discussing the view. Since the time we moved to Goa, I have seen them many times from different trains that I have taken. However, it is now that we got an opportunity to visit the waterfalls to admire it in its full glory. Dudhsagar literally means the ocean of milk. Here is the story that tells us how it got the name.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legend is that there was a lake in the western ghats. This is where a princess used to come for bathing every day with her friends. After the bath, they used to drink milk – as much as a jug of milk. One fine day as they were playing in the lake a young man passed by. He stopped to look at the maidens in water. The maidens to save their dignity poured the milk in a way that it created a curtain of milk.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is believed that since then the waterfall is flowing creating a curtain of milk.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure about the story, but I can tell you that once you have heard the story the waterfall does look a wee bit milkier in appearance. On the Jeep ride from forest gate to Dudhsagar, you would find some houses – which means some people live inside. We even saw a sugarcane field and we were told the workers in this field come in the morning and leave by the evening.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two temples that we saw – one belongs to Dudhsagar Baba. Now I am not sure who he really is but the temple looks fairly new. As we are not allowed to get off the jeep, we could not visit the temple.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second temple belongs to Satteri – the goddess that can be seen all over Goa. Between Satteri and Shantadurga it would be difficult to choose who would be the presiding deity of Goa. And as some would say, both of them are different versions of the same divine feminine. We reached Mollem around 9 AM & joined the long queue to get the Jeep ticket. It was an exceptionally crowded day and it took us nearly 2 hours to get the ticket. Once in Jeep, we had to wait for almost an hour outside the forest gate. We were told that they are trying to limit the overall number of Jeeps inside the park.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We admired the quiet and absolutely clean Mandovi flowing next to our waiting queue. I was hoping to see some animals or birds but then with so many jeeps and humans around it was asking for too much.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing the forest gate we started driving through the thick jungle. At places, we passed through the canopy of trees and at other places we could see some habitation. We crossed two small streams and many other smaller streams smiled at us through the drive. The road was muddy and slushy, as the monsoons have still not completely gone.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Jeep Parking place that was obviously full of Jeeps and tourists they brought in, there is Watchtower. If you do not want to trek for 1 km from here, this is your best bet to admire the fall. The view of the falls is nice. Monkeys of the wildlife sanctuary, however, think that the Watchtower is their place, so you would need to deal with them." - https://www.inditales.com/dudhsagar-falls-most-beautiful-waterfall-goa/<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></span></div>

											<span id="testingthis6"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The word Kalahari is thought to be a derivative of a word meaning “great thirst or a waterless place”.  Most people think of it as a great desert in southern Africa, and tell its story as the struggle for life in the desolate Kalahari sands.  These tales focus on the time of the year when the landscape is hibernating from the heat — too thirsty to grow, too hot to move, too dusty to breathe.  However, this annual phase is only part of the legend of the Kalahari, just a facet of its character.  Only defining the Kalahari as a desert is akin to only appreciating a diamond for its strength.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It omits the chapter that buzzes and struts with life just after the first rains fall.  It does not describe herds of springbok pronking in plains of finger grass, or the kaleidoscope of African Monarch butterflies dancing around wild dagga flowers.  It does not include the sparkles of the dew perched on the acacia thorns at sunrise, or the korhaans that descend like helicopters into the tall grass.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of the flourishing Kalahari Plains in the north of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR), is the seldom told tale of the Kalahari’s dazzle.  The renewed verve of the wildlife leisurely lapping water, and gracefully grazing the savannah, until they are plump and strong.  The processions of ostrich crossing the plains flaunting shiny plumage, while black maned lions prune their fluffy manes, and baby helmeted guineafowl scurry through the bush after the flock. To really know the Kalahari, you must see its soft side.  The intimate character it only reveals once a year while relaxing in the rains. The best place to make its acquaintance is probably at he Central Kalahari Game Reserve in Botswana.  In the north of the reserve, small pans turn into savannahs, and little groves of dwarfed camelthorn trees attract oryx seeking to snack on their seedpods.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying low over the Kalahari in a small plane really provides perspective on how the rain transforms the landscape.  The pilot navigates through big puffy clouds, and the ground below is the raggedy texture of an old tennis ball.   It emanates scruffy shades of green as wild gemsbok cucumber, devil’s claw, buffalo thorn, and acacia, spring to life between fields of natal and crowfoot grasses.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild stock rose and hibiscus flowers rise above the grasses, and flamboyantly named butterflies like the green-eyed monster, and the queen purple tip, flutter together, like flower petals drifting in a breeze. This Kalahari welcoming show is worth making a trip to see. As the savannah spreads across the Kalahari sands, the cats find time to play.  Herds are everywhere, and the predators are well concealed in the tall grasses.  Near the Kalahari Plains Camp we found the Plains Pride of lions consisting of three females, and six cubs.  They are protected by two roaming brothers with movie star black manes known as the Owens brothers.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The females are the backbone of the pride.  While they allowed the cubs to come tackle each other around our vehicle, the lady lions also displayed a show of strength to any interlopers, roaring together in a grumbling tone that made our skin shiver.  The curious lion cubs batted at butterflies in fields of flowers, and pounced on frogs hiding in small puddles of water.  It is the time of year to lounge and learn the lessons of life.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The males laid near each other rolling around on their backs in the tall grass like kittens.  The power of their alliance seemed to give them comfort, as there was unlikely to be any threat to their combined strength.  The dominant brother kept watch over the pride, but just between cat naps, and amid a series of attempts by the cubs bite his tail.  Then, in the night, his brother betrayed him by sneaking away with one of the females that went into estrus.  A classic Kalahari soap opera.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, lions are certainly not the only cats of the Kalahari.  One evening we sat watching the sunset, and saw the curious face of the African Wild Cat peer above the savannah grasses.  Unperturbed by our presence, it bounded back and forth through the grass as if it had just found a cache of Kalahari cat nip.  In Deception Valley, we spotted the pointy black tipped ears of a caracal twitching above the grasses.  It sauntered right in front of us, starring back at us with glacial blue eyes." - http://www.nomadic-by-nature.com/pronking-on-the-kalahari-plains-botswana/<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></span></div>
